    <P>
      shale.css is a simple CSS framework / React component library which provides
      some pesudo-skeuomorphic looking components for quick prototyping.
    </P>

    <P>
      The project grew out of the old <Link href="https://startnine.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Start9 website</Link> CSS. I
      wanted to do something with it after the project was discontinued because
      of sunk-cost fallacy.
    </P>

    <P>The project is WIP and is not meant to be enterprise or anything</P>
