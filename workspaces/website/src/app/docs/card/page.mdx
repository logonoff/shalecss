import { Card } from "@shalecss/react";

The `Card` component is a flexible container based on FlexItem that provides a card-like visual presentation with optional shadow variants.

## Props

*extends `FlexItem` props*

- `shadow` (optional): The type of shadow to apply to the card. Can be one of the shadow variants defined in the framework.
- `Component` (optional): The underlying component to render. Defaults to `FlexItem`. This makes the component polymorphic.

## Example

<Card shadow="medium">
  Card content goes here
</Card>

```tsx
import { Card } from "@shalecss/react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Card shadow="medium">
      This is a card with a medium shadow
    </Card>
  );
};
```

## Polymorphic Usage

Since Card is polymorphic, you can render it as any component:

```tsx
<Card Component="section" shadow="large">
  Card content as a section
</Card>
```
