shale.css is a modern CSS framework designed to make web development faster and easier. It provides a set of pre-designed components and utilities that can be easily integrated into any project.

## Structure

The project is organized into two workspaces:

- `core`: Contains the core styles and utilities of shale.css.
- `react`: A React component library built on top of shale.css.

### Core

The `core` workspace is written in SCSS and includes the base styles, layout utilities, and component styles.


### React

The `react` workspace is a thin wrapper over the core styles, providing React components that can be easily used in React applications.
