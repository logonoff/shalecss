import { Typography, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, P, Code } from "@shalecss/react";

The `Typography` component and its variants provide styled text elements with a consistent design system.

## Typography Component

The base `Typography` component is polymorphic and can render as any HTML element with the appropriate typography styles.

### Props

- `variant` (optional): The variant style to apply. Can be one of: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `code`. Defaults to `p`.
- `Component` (optional): The underlying HTML element to render. Defaults to the value of `variant`.

### Example

```tsx
import { Typography } from "@shalecss/react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Typography variant="h1">
      This is a heading
    </Typography>
  );
};
```

## Typography Variants

For convenience, pre-configured components are available for each variant:

### H1

<H1>Heading 1</H1>

```tsx
import { H1 } from "@shalecss/react";

<H1>Heading 1</H1>
```

### H2

<H2>Heading 2</H2>

```tsx
import { H2 } from "@shalecss/react";

<H2>Heading 2</H2>
```

### H3

<H3>Heading 3</H3>

```tsx
import { H3 } from "@shalecss/react";

<H3>Heading 3</H3>
```

### H4

<H4>Heading 4</H4>

```tsx
import { H4 } from "@shalecss/react";

<H4>Heading 4</H4>
```

### H5

<H5>Heading 5</H5>

```tsx
import { H5 } from "@shalecss/react";

<H5>Heading 5</H5>
```

### H6

<H6>Heading 6</H6>

```tsx
import { H6 } from "@shalecss/react";

<H6>Heading 6</H6>
```

### P (Paragraph)

<P>This is a paragraph with styled text.</P>

```tsx
import { P } from "@shalecss/react";

<P>This is a paragraph with styled text.</P>
```

### Code

<Code>const example = "code";</Code>

```tsx
import { Code } from "@shalecss/react";

<Code>const example = "code";</Code>
```

## Polymorphic Usage

All typography components are polymorphic and can be rendered as different HTML elements:

```tsx
<H1 Component="div">
  This renders as a div but looks like an H1
</H1>

<P Component="span">
  This renders as a span but looks like a paragraph
</P>
```
